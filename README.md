# Parallel Computing 

Works only on systems with NVIDIA GPU and proper CUDA drivers.

This repository contains CUDA/C++ source codes for all major practicals and assignments of the undergraduate Parallel Computing course, covering topics such as Amdahlâ€™s Law, vector and matrix operations, shared memory, reduction, texture memory, image processing, and lightweight scientific applications.

## Installation (Ubuntu)

1. **Install CUDA Toolkit**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
   nvcc --version
   ```

2. **Install OpenCV (for image processing codes)**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install libopencv-dev
   pkg-config --modversion opencv4
   ```

3. **Install Build Essentials**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake git pkg-config
   ```

## Compilation and Execution

Compile a CUDA file:

```bash
cd src
nvcc 02_vector_addition_1d.cu -o vector_add
./vector_add
```

Compile a CUDA file using OpenCV:

```bash
nvcc -std=c++17 06_image_processing.cu -o image_proc `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
./image_proc
```
