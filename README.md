# Parallel Computing Course â€“ CUDA Practical Codes
  
This repository contains **CUDA/C++ source codes** for all major practicals and assignments of the undergraduate *Parallel Computing* course, including core topics like vector addition, matrix multiplication (various methods), reduction, and basic image processing using NVIDIA GPUs.


## Contribution Guidelines

* This repo is **code-only**: no notes, no theory.
* All code should be self-contained, clean, and build with `nvcc`.
* If adding a new practical, follow the folder naming and file template pattern.
* Test your code on at least 1K input size before submitting.
